It is a story of deep contradictions — of Kissinger’s obsession with securing American supremacy, staving off nuclear war, and checking the power of our enemies, even while consorting with dictators and tolerating widespread violation of human rights.",

Without speaking, they start a playful game of rock-paper-scissors, their laughter filling the empty station. But as the girl’s train arrives, their connection is cut short. She waves from the window, and he waves back, smiling. The elderly woman, watching from afar, is reminded that even the briefest encounters can create lasting memories of joy and shared humanity.",
