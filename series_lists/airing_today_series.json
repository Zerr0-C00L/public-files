Wright drew inspiration from his experiences of being interrogated by the Gestapo during World War II.\n\nThe atmosphere is helped by Mastermind's famously ominous theme music, \"Approaching Menace\" by the British composer Neil Richardson. The quiz programme originated and was recorded in Manchester at studios such as New Broadcasting House and Granada Studios, before permanently moving to MediaCityUK in 2011.",
