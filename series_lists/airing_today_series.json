Jezabel's manipulations and lies cause Antonio to abandon Aurora, with Gabriel in her arms, on their wedding day. Blinded by his sexism, Miguel, Aurora's father, snatches her son from her and gives him to Pascual Santos, who raises him with his wife Victoria. Twenty-nine years later, Gabriel is now Ángel Santos, a humbly educated man, but with the strongest family values. Despite all the years that have passed, Aurora does not lose hope of finding her son Gabriel and discovers that she can love again thanks to Julio César Rey, a lawyer at Corporativo Campero, where she is president.",
