The series debuted in 22 April 2007 and became popular thanks to its funny characters, witty script, use of catchphrases and capacity to integrate and poke fun at contemporary issues; the program presents a caustic satire of many of the 'types' found in Spanish society.\n\nThe name of the show involves wordplay, as \"vecina\" is the Spanish word for neighbour.",

Wright drew inspiration from his experiences of being interrogated by the Gestapo during World War II.\n\nThe atmosphere is helped by Mastermind's famously ominous theme music, \"Approaching Menace\" by the British composer Neil Richardson. The quiz programme originated and was recorded in Manchester at studios such as New Broadcasting House and Granada Studios, before permanently moving to MediaCityUK in 2011.",

Author and tennis legend Björn Hellberg was promoted from contestant to permanent Oldsberg sidekick in 1995 after winning for four straight seasons. Famous gourmet, restaurant-owner, and former contestant Carl-Jan Grankvist sat in for Hellberg during the 2004 season.\n\nIn 2009, after 21 years, Oldsberg left and Kristian Luuk took over as the host.

The townspeople believe he is Kamil, a long-lost son returned; only he knows the truth. But the past never lets go—old enemies, blood feuds, and the ghosts of his choices haunt him still. As he uncovers a shocking secret—that this family is bound to him by blood—Iskender stands at a crossroads. Revenge or redemption? Will he remain the ruthless survivor the streets created, or dare to become the man he was meant to be? This is a story of love, betrayal, and the price of becoming truly human.",
