Presented by Universal Pictures and Vanity Fair, and hosted by Chris Murphy, this series features intimate conversations with Cynthia Erivo, Ariana Grande, and the cast – along with Director Jon M. Chu and the visionary creative team that brought this beloved story to life.\n\nOver eight weeks, we’ll pull back the emerald curtain to uncover the secrets of making Wicked – from building the massive sets and recording the iconic songs, to crafting the dazzling costumes, makeup, and visual language that reimagined Oz for a new generation, all while tackling the challenge of filming two movies at once.\n\nFollowing the release of Wicked: For Good on November 21, we’ll travel even further down the yellow brick road to explore story changes, performances, Easter eggs, and the creative evolution that makes these films one of cinema’s most spellbinding productions.",
